Question 1
a. Output:
20
30
43
are
some
positive
numbers.

Their

b. Output:
20    30          43 are some positive numbers.
   Their average is: 31.0     
That's it!
count: 3

c. Output:

43.0
count: 3

Question 2
a. 5 8
   [2, 4, 7, 8, 10]
b. 3 8 8 
   This makes sense because while y is the same as x, y is its own separate array. z and y both 
   reference the same array so changing a value in either z or y changes the same array. 
c. The mystery method replaces the element of the array given by the third parameter with the 
   value of the second parameter while shifting the rest of the elements in the array down by one 
   (unless the element being replaced is the last element, in which case the values are just 
   replaced without any shifting of the other elements).

Question 3
a.
public static boolean contains(int[] data, int value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        if (data[i] == value) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

b.
public static int schoolNumber(String school) {
    for (int i = 0; i < SCHOOL_ABBREVS.length; i++) {
        if (SCHOOL_ABBREVS[i].equals(school)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

c.
public static void negate(int[] data) {
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        data[i] = data[i] * -1;
    }
}
