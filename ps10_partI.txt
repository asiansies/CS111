Problem Set 10 | Part 1

Question 2
a. private ArrayList<File> chapters;
b. this.chapters = new ArrayList<File>(numChapters);
c. chapterCount is no longer needed. chapterCount manually keeps track of the number of chapters
   added. ArrayList has a size() method which we can call to figure out the current number of 
   values, which in this case would be the number of chapters added.
d. public void addChapter(File chapter) {
       this.chapters.add(chapter);
   }
e. public File getChapter(int chapterNum) {
       this.chapters.get(chapterNum - 1);
   }
   
Question 3
public class MovingVan extends Truck {
	private int distanceToCargo;
	private boolean hasRamp;
	
	//A constructor for a MovingVan object.
	public MovingVan(String make, String model, int year, int numWheels, int distanceToCargo, boolean hasRamp) {
		super(make, model, year, numWheels);
		
		if (distanceToCargo <= 0) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException();
		}
		this.distanceToCargo = distanceToCargo;;
		this.hasRamp = hasRamp;
	}		
	
	//Returns the distance from the ground to the cargo area of the called MovingVan object.
	public int getDistanceToCargo() {
		return this.distanceToCargo;
	}
	
	//Returns true if the MovingVan object has a ramp and false if it doesn't.
	public boolean hasRamp() {
		return this.hasRamp;
	}
	
	//Returns a String representation of a MovingVan object.
	public String toString() {
		String s = "capacity = " + this.capacity + ", distance to cargo = " + this.distanceToCargo;
		if (hasRamp) {
			s += s + ", has a ramp"
		} else {
			s += s + ", no ramp"
		}
	}
}

Question 4
a. Valid: Vehicle objects can hold references to objects that are subclasses of Vehicle. Truck is 
   a subclass of Vehicle.
b. Invalid: Objects can only hold references to objects of their subclasses. In this case, 
   Automobile is a superclass of Taxi and therefore, Taxi cannot hold a reference to Automobile.
c. Valid: Object objects can hold references to any type of object.

Question 5
a. weezow zow eekzee
b. weeyow yow eekzee
c. weeyow yow eekzee
d. Does not compile. Zoo is instantiated as a Yoo so it only has access to methods from the Yoo 
   class and Zoo class.
