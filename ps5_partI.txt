Problem Set 5
Part I

Question 1
a. i. ruby
      pearl
      done
  ii. ruby
      pearl
      done
 iii. diamond
      pearl
      done
  iv. silver
      done
   v. penny
      nickel
      done

b. The line that prints "copper" will never be executed because it is inside a nested if-else 
   statement inside an else statement. In order to get to the if-else statement that prints 
   "copper", it must fail the test of the outermost if statement, which is a <= b. "copper" only 
   gets printed if a < b, which we know by now is false.
   
   The line that prints "gold" will also never be executed because by failing the first test
   in the outer if statement (a <= b) and passing the second test from the else if statement 
   (b >= c), we know that a must be greater than b and b must be greater than or equal to c.
   Therefore, a can never be greater than c, and it will fail the test to print out "gold" (a < c). 

   The line that prints "dime" will also never run because it's test is a == b. It is in the
   last else block which means that it has already failed the other two tests for a <= b
   and b >= c. Failing the first test ( a <= b) would also mean that it would fail a == b.


Question 2
public static void processIntegers(int x, int y) {
    if (x <= y) {
        int sum = x;
        System.out.print(x);
        while (x < y){
            x++;
            System.out.print(", " + x);
            sum += x;    
        }
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("total = " + sum);
    }
}


Question 3
a. i. 7 interations
  ii. infinite loop
 iii. 1 iteration
  iv. no iterations
   v. 4 iterations

b. public static void printEvens(int a, int b) {
        while (a % 2 == 0 && a <= b) {
            System.out.print(a + " ");
            a +=2;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }


Question 4
a. while (num <= 10 || num % 2 != 0)
b. while (num <= 10 || num >= 20)
c. while (num != 5 && num != 10)
d. while (num / 10 != num % 10)
e. Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
   int num;
   boolean validInput = false;
   while (!validInput) {
       System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
       num = console.nextInt();
       validInput = num > 10;
   }
