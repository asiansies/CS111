Problem Set 2 | Part I

Question 1
i. a / b = 2.333
   a / c = 2
   While both expressions evaluate to 7/3, the first expression contains a double and will 
   therefore give you an answer of type double. The second expression uses integer division so 
   the answer will be truncated to whatever comes before the decimal point.
ii. d / a * a = 5.0
    (int)d / a * a = 0
    The first expression contains a double and will be evaluated like "normal" division. The second 
    expression converts d into an integer. In Java, with integer division, 5/7 will evaluate to 0. 
    0 times anything is still 0.
iii. a + b = 10.0
     "a" + "b" = ab
     The first expression is normal addition. The answer contains a decimal place because it is of 
     type double. In the second expression, the characters are enclosed in quotations, turning them 
     into strings. The second expression concatenates two strings.
iv. 6 + 2 + " foo " = 8 foo
    " foo " + 6 + 2 =  foo 62
    The first expression will do the addition first and then add the string. The second expression 
    will concatenate " foo " and 6 and proceed to concatenate the 2.
v. b * a / c = 7.0
   b * (a / c) = 6.0
   The first expression evaluates from left to right. In the second expression, the inside of the 
   parenthesis will get evaluated first and then the mulitplication will happen.

Question 2
i. k = 2 * j;
ii. j = j + 5;
iii. k = j % 10;
iv.  k = j % 100 / 10;
v. j = 6
   k = 14

Question 3
i. 101 = 2^0 + 2^2
       = 1 + 4
       = 5
   1100101 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6
	   = 1 + 4 + 32 + 64
           = 5 + 32 + 64
           = 37 + 64
           = 101
ii. 14 = 8 + 4 + 2
       = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
       = 00001110   
    57 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 1
       = 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^0
       = 00111001

Question 4
a. for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       System.out.println("Repeat!");
   }
b. for (int i = 4; i <= 10; i = i + 2) { 
       System.out.print(i + " ");
   }
